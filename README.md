### About Me
Feel free to browse the respositories from a beginning developer and the progress I have made to building 
in-depth full-stack applications with a variety of features.

During my journey I have discovered a passion for not just the user experience (UX) in the front-end (Vue.js), 
but incorporating the back-end logic (preferably C##, but node.js will always be my first).

I have a few private projects under way that I am working on and constantly go back to touch up previous projects,
but I love learning coding languages and different frameworks. I am currently learning SalesForce and React.js as new 
frameworks and tools for under my belt because even though I did find a passion for coding, SalesForce helps incorporates
my other passion for helping people.

If you have any questions or would like any clarifications on any projects I am more than happy to talk with you!
Please feel free to reach out thru LinkedIn or even Gmail that I linked at the top.


Have a blessed day and hope to hear from you soon!
