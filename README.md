### About Me
Feel free to browse the respositories from a beginning developer and the progress I have made to building 
in-depth full-stack applications with a variety of features.

During my journey I have discovered a passion for not just the user experience (UX) in the front-end (Vue.js), 
but incorporating the back-end logic (preferably C#, but node.js will always be my first).

I have a few private projects under way that I am working on and constantly go back to touch up previous projects,
but I love learning a variety of coding languages and different frameworks. I am currently learning SalesForce and plan to learn Java even more so, to have additional tools under my belt because even though I did find a passion for coding, SalesForce helps incorporates
my other passion for helping people.

If you have any questions or would like any clarifications on any projects I am more than happy to talk with you!
Please feel free to reach out thru LinkedIn or even Gmail that I linked at the top.

Have a blessed day and hope to hear from you soon!

### Projects

##### [Keepr]()
Full-Stack application (Vue.js and C#) that incorporates multiple different style relationships (i.e., one to one, one to many, and many to many), where a user is able to create their own vaults and keeps, which are used to add to certain individual public or private vaults (i.e., only seen by the creator). Keeps are tracked by the number of times viewed and "kept" in individual vaults. User's are able to add another user's keeps to their own vault (i.e., vaultKeeps) and is able to delete them once added to vault

##### [CarbonNone](https://ecosistent.herokuapp.com/#/)
Full-Stack application (Vue.js and Node.js), built by 4 developers to help track home utilities (i.e., electricity and water) and car emissions (i.e., based off miles driven vs gas type). Multple Api's incorporated to application.

##### [Kanban](https://kankanban.herokuapp.com/#/) 
Full-Stack application (Vue.js and Node.js) built mainly with a partner (few additonal tweaks) to track varying projects that allows for lists for each project, tasks for each list, and comments on each task.

##### [BugLogger](https://bugloggger.herokuapp.com/#/)
Full-Stack application (Vue.js and Node.js) to track varying "bugs" by creator and time created, with the ability to sort the "closed" bugs, but able to add notes to each individual bug page.
##### [Inspire](https://austinjdowney.github.io/Inspire/)
MVC application incorporating multiple different Api's to track weather, a create a todo list and track different completed tasks, randomized quote/HD background image generator that changes on refresh, and also a real time clock with motivational message.
