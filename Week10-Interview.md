# Interview Practice

### Share your skills
  ##### What is your background?
   ###### - Having received my Bachelors of Science in Psychology, my background since then has primarily been helping people, whether that was in sales, counseling, guest/client service. I have always prided myself with being able to empathize with others, which has really helped with my success, along with constantly grinding and trying to work hard.
  ##### What are some accomplishments you want to share? What is the value you can bring?
   ###### - Working at Olive Garden I receive a plethora of raving positive reviews from guests in there satisfaction not just with the food, but with being able to create an amazing experience for them to want to want to comeback. This has allowed me to receive a great deal of responsibility in different roles, as well, with training/helping other servers, being cross-trained in multiple other roles, but this is a consistent theme that I have been promoted or at least given more responsibilities relative to other individual's in a similar role as me, at every place I have worked, which I am very proud of.
  ##### What are your career goals or aspirations?
   ###### - My goal is to be in a career where I feel challenged mentally on a daily basis, so that way I can constantly improve myself and ideally be able to have room to grow in that career, but also hopefully in a role that I am able to benefit others, as well. 
### STAR method-Interview Questions

   ###### -
### Questions for employer
 ##### 1. What is your base expectation for someone just starting in this role?
 ##### 2. What is the culture like between employees? Do people typically keep to themselves or more like to collaborate?
 ##### 3. Are individuals able to grow in their role? Any assistance from employers for certifications?
 ##### 4. Does the company have any plans for growth in any area? Getting a Pac-Man machine(kidding.. kind of)
 ##### 5. What tend to be the biggest challenges in this role for your company?
### Summary preparing for interview
 ##### I went over as many scenarios I could think of based off the most common interview questions, in order to be mentally prepared for what may have been brought up to be able to provide the most ideal answer from a real experience. The other big thing is to get as much sleep as possible and to remember to just be the most real/best YOU you can be. Being authentic, true to yourself, and relaxed is the best mindset I believe entering an interview that may change the direction of your life.
