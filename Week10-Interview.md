# Interview Practice

### Share your skills

  ##### What is your background?
   ###### - Having received my Bachelors of Science in Psychology, my background since then has primarily been helping people, whether that was in sales, counseling, guest/client service. I have always prided myself with being able to empathize with others, which has really helped with my success, along with constantly grinding and trying to work hard.
  ##### What are some accomplishments you want to share? What is the value you can bring?
   ###### - Working at Olive Garden I receive a plethora of raving positive reviews from guests in there satisfaction not just with the food, but with being able to create an amazing experience for them to want to want to comeback. This has allowed me to receive a great deal of responsibility in different roles, as well, with training/helping other servers, being cross-trained in multiple other roles, but this is a consistent theme that I have been promoted or at least given more responsibilities relative to other individual's in a similar role as me, at every place I have worked, which I am very proud of.
  ##### What are your career goals or aspirations?
   ###### - My goal is to be in a career where I feel challenged mentally on a daily basis, so that way I can constantly improve myself and ideally be able to have room to grow in that career, but also hopefully in a role that I am able to benefit others, as well. 
   
### STAR method-Interview Questions

  ##### Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasnâ€™t very responsive. What did you do?
   ###### - Situation: While working at Olive Garden, there are a lot of times where there are certain tables/groups of individual's that are not very talkative, or possibly even just not having a good day. However, when trying to create an amazing experience for a table you want make it an engaging atmosphere, but not seem overwhelmingly abrasive. For example, with one table in particular just recently, they would cut me off whenever I would try to ask them anything about how their experience is going and try to create a dialog. Additionally, whenever I would get a question actually in inbetween their breaths, both individual's would just be quiet. 
   ###### - Task: During these times, when a table might be closed off and less likely to engage with you, I make it my mission to do anything I can to make the table laugh, without being overbearing and just using subtle jokes to lighten the mood.
   ###### - Action: Being from New York and working at an italian restaurant, I will use my New York accent to be creative with pushing back a bit on them, especially when they were not pleased that I didn't offer to "toss their salad", that of which is not standard working at Olive Garden. I proceeded to respond in my New York accent, which caught them off gaurd because they hadn't heard me speak like that, and pushed back on them a bit in a light hearted way, but really broke the ice with that table.
   ###### - Resolution: I pride myself in finding different ways to connect with people and actually later found out that one of individual's had just gone through a bad break up, so a male server was not ideal for them. However, when I pushed back a bit on their request, in a light-hearted way, they definitely enjoyed the respected the response and acknowledged that they hadn't been in a great mood, but that I really helped make their day better.
  ##### Describe a time you had to interact with a difficult client. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?
   ###### - Situation: When working at the Kuna Counseling Center, one of my main clients/patients, whom was 13 years old, 6'2", and roughly 300 lbs, had very bad anger problems and diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder. I was specifically brought in, because he had been bullying a smaller kid at his school pretty badly, and my director at the counseling center knew I wasn't afraid of a challenge.
   ###### - Task: My task was to engage with him on his past behavior and how it's not just affecting him and even his family, but how is physical stature creates preconceptions already for other individual's. Additionally, if he kept behaving as he was, then he would continue to be in trouble throughout his life and most likely end up somewhere similar to his father that he may not be able to just go back home after from.
   ###### - Action: Being 13 and his size, he knew he had big physical presence, but me being not very tall and pretty athletic, I would take him to go play basketball at the school nearby to help him relax and for him to really talk with me. At first, he thought it would be unfair, but I quickly showed him that not everything is what it seems and wouldn't take it easy on him whenever we would play. He started to respect my approach and eventually started to realize that just because he is a certain size doesn't mean he will just able to push everyone around and even more importantly should.
   ###### Resolution: This definitely took time to be able to help him with and to be able to realize that he may get away with trying to push around kids that are smaller because he was large for his age, but eventually those kids will catch up to him and that he may find someone that isn't afraid to push back, and then you never know what might happen if they do. After a couple months of working with him though, I did receive a call from his school counselor asking what I had been working with him on because they were shocked that he ended up befriending the same kid that he had been bullying just weeks prior and would even protect him from other kid's that were trying to bully him.
  ##### Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going, and how did you get through it?
   ###### - Situation: During my time at CodeWorks, we had started our final projects and I was working on the server side of my final when I started getting an error on my Postman tests that I had never seen before. After a plethora of googling and going over every line of code I had, since it was Saturday I had to wait until Tuesday to try and ask one the more Senior Developers what I had possibly missed.
   ###### - Task: Since we only have a week for the final, time was definitely a factor and not wanting to wait a couple days to try to further debug my code, so that my server would adhere to the Postman tests.
   ###### - Action: Given time was of the essence, I ended up working on my client side without having finished my server side, but I wanted to utilize all the time I had to at least accomplish the tasks that I was able to until I was more able to find assistance finding an answer.
   ###### - Resolution: I definitely had to be creative with what I was adding in my client side, but appropriately time-boxing myself to accomplish the tasks I knew I was confident in, in order to get more ahead in the application I beleive better set me up for success with the final.
  ##### Tell me about a time you set a goal for yourself. How did you go about ensuring you would meet your objective?
   ###### - Situation: When I was working at Axiom as the Lead Fitness Counselor, January for the gym industry was always the busiest month of the year, but I consistently would try to set high goals for myself to achieve, relative to what the business goals were, to hopefully increase the likelihood that the team hit the main goal, but also so that I would keep setting a high bar for myself.
   ###### - Task: With January expectedly the busiest day of the year, the expectations were already high for the amount of business that was supposed to be drawn in, and not just me, but I had amazing fitness counselors that also had the mindset that we all didn't want to just hit the goal, but exceed the goal that was given to us.
   ###### - Action: I planned out for everyday of the month how many appointments I expected to have for each day to break down what would be the ideal amount of appointments I would need, relative to previous sales closing percentages and my goal for the month. I would every morning look at my progress to remind myself if I needed to set more appointments for given days to keep my progress on track, so I always knew where I was at.
   ###### - Resolution: At the end of that specific January month when I was the Lead Fitness Counselor, we not only met the team goal for memberships/revenue by over 30%, but I had exceeded my goal by almost 50% for memberships/training/revenue, as well!
  ##### Give me an example of a time when you had to explain something fairly complex to a frustrated client. How did you handle this delicate situation? 
   ###### - Situation: Working at the Kuna Counseling Center, I had another client, whom was 16 and a savant with technological architecture, but was diagnosed with a few different disorders, such as ADHD, PTSD, and Social Anxiety disorder. I was not only having to teach him good practices though, but his mother, as well.
   ###### - Task: I would consistently work with him on organzing his room that had different tools and pieces around everywhere that he would always be soldering to try and piece different gaming consoles together, which he was very successful at. However, his mom had a bad hoarding problem, which he inherited, where they both had difficulties letting anything go and actually organizing their belongings in a coherent manner, which made helping her son difficult because the second I would leave, then she had a hard time trying to enforce what I worked with them on when they both enabled each other.
   ###### - Action: While I was at their home, I would always iterate to them how important it was not just for health reasons, but for a peace of mind having everything in a certain spot and not having to worry about all the clutter. I would help them a bit keep things organized, but I made explaining the importance of them cleaning, even when I was there, a point because they both knew I wouldn't always be around and they had to be the ones putting just that little bit of effort in to keep things clean. They both explained to me that they felt embarassed to have people over because of how dirty/cluttered there home would get, which sent them both down a depressive spiral and why I had been sent in the first place.
   ###### - Resolution: After months of working with them both, they both had made progress with helping keep each other accountable on their cleanliness and picking up after themselves just right in that moment, because they both were seeing themselves make great strides and then have the occassional slip up, which with my repeated iterations of how important it is to just finish cleaning up in that moment, so all their belongings and tasks compound on one another, I believe really helped them be more consistent without my oversight.
   
### Questions for employer

 ##### 1. What is your base expectation for someone just starting in this role?
 ##### 2. What is the culture like between employees? Do people typically keep to themselves or more like to collaborate?
 ##### 3. Are individuals able to grow in their role? Any assistance from employers for certifications?
 ##### 4. Does the company have any plans for growth in any area? Getting a Pac-Man machine(kidding.. kind of)
 ##### 5. What tend to be the biggest challenges in this role for your company?
 
### Summary preparing for interview

 ##### I went over as many scenarios I could think of based off the most common interview questions, in order to be mentally prepared for what may have been brought up to be able to provide the most ideal answer from a real experience. The other big thing is to get as much sleep as possible and to remember to just be the most real/best YOU you can be. Being authentic, true to yourself, and relaxed is the best mindset I believe entering an interview that may change the direction of your life.  
 
 ### Summary for Whiteboard Challenge Practice
  ##### Alec and I both practiced doing whiteboard challenge questions. I had done a variation of FizzBuzz with 7 and 9, plus needing to account if none of the numbers provided where divisible by 7 and 9. Additionally, I had also done MaxChar, which was a bit more difficult, but highlighted the need to possibly just become a bit more comfortable with adapting the different types of for loops to one another, in certain situations off hand, for a more concise result. Still got the answer though, just had a couple more steps than if I had done a for of loop.
